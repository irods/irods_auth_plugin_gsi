iRODS GSI Auth Plugin
---------------------

To build the GSI Auth Plugin, you will need to have:

 - the iRODS Development Tools (irods-dev and irods-runtime) installed for your platform
     http://irods.org/download

 - globus-proxy-utils installed for your platform

Note:

Once installed, the `X509_USER_CERT` and `X509_USER_KEY` are necessary to be set for the service EVEN IF the default paths are used.
(i.e. /etc/grid-security/service/servicekey(cert).pem)
