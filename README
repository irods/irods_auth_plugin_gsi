iRODS GSI Auth Plugin
---------------------

To build the GSI Auth Plugin, you will need to have:

 - the iRODS Development Tools (irods-dev and irods-runtime) installed for your platform
     http://irods.org/download

 - globus-proxy-utils installed for your platform

 - For Debian based platforms you would need to install libglobus-gssapi-gsi-dev, libssl-dev, libkrb5-dev

 - For Redhat based platforms you would need to install globus-gssapi-gsi-devel, openssl-devel, krb5-devel

 - Make symbolic links for libglobus_gss_assist.so.3 and libglobus_callout.so.0

Note:

Once installed, the `X509_USER_CERT` and `X509_USER_KEY` are necessary to be set for the service EVEN IF the default paths are used.
(i.e. /etc/grid-security/service/servicekey(cert).pem)
